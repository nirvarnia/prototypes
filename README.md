# Prototypes

This repository contains prototypes for UI components developed for the Nirvarnia frontend web design system.

Each prototype is a self-contained HTML file, which can be loaded directly in a browser from your local filesystem. In most cases, no server is required to test the prototypes.

Refer to the source code for comments on the techniques trialed in each prototype, and links to sources.
